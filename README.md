# Psychic-Game


This is a very simple game to play. 
You have 9 chances to choose a letter that matches the computer guess.
Also your choices are tracked so you can see what you already typed in. 
If you key in a letter and it matches the computer guess, you win.
Your total wins go up by one and your chances are still unchanged. 
If you lose that means your letter does not match the computer choice.
Then, your total losses increments by 1 and your chances decreases by 1.
Once you run out of chances, the game starts over. 
Just follow the instructions on the screen to start it.
